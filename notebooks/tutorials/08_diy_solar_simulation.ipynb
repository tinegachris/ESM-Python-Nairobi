    "# Bonus Tutorial: Optimizing a Simple Solar Home System\n",
    "\n",
    "This bonus tutorial demonstrates how PyPSA can model a small, real-life energy system, like a Solar Home System (SHS) commonly used in off-grid areas or for backup power. This is relevant for DIY enthusiasts or understanding small-scale energy management in contexts like Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** We have a small household with basic electricity needs (lights, phone charging). They have installed a small solar PV panel and a battery.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** We want to simulate the operation of this system over a typical day to see how the solar panel charges the battery and powers the load. This helps assess if the chosen component sizes (PV panel, battery) are likely sufficient for the expected daily usage, minimizing reliance on any potential backup (or minimizing unmet load if fully off-grid).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concepts Covered:**\n",
    "- Defining `Bus`, `Generator` (PV), `Store` (Battery), `Load`.\n",
    "- Using simple time-series data for solar availability (`p_max_pu`) and load (`p_set`).\n",
    "- Running a basic operational simulation (`optimize`).\n",
    "- Visualizing system behaviour (PV output, Load, Battery State of Charge)."

    "## Summary & Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple example shows how PyPSA can model the interplay between solar generation, battery storage, and household demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **During the day:** The PV panel generates electricity. This power meets the immediate load, and any excess is used to charge the battery (observe negative power in the second plot and rising SOC in the third plot).\n",
    "- **During the evening/night:** When PV generation is low or zero, the battery discharges (positive power in the second plot, falling SOC in the third plot) to meet the household load.\n",
    "- **Optimization Goal:** The `optimize` function implicitly minimizes the cost. Since PV is free (marginal_cost=0) and the battery has a tiny cost, the system prioritizes using PV directly, then storing excess PV in the battery, and finally discharging the battery to meet the load. The expensive \"Unmet Load\" generator is only used if the PV and battery cannot meet the demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model could be extended to:\n",
    "- Use more realistic, granular weather data and load profiles.\n",
    "- Include costs for components to perform sizing optimization (like Tutorial 05).\n",
    "- Model grid connection or other backup sources.\n",
    "- Analyze different battery sizes or PV panel capacities."
